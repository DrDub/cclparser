Changes
=======

This file specifies the most important changes in each release version
of the ccl-parser.

Version: 1.0.0.2
CVS tag: VERSION_1_0_0_2
Date: September 18 2008

Some compilation problems with newer gcc version (4.3.0) were fixed. 
This included adding some missing header files and adding missing 'const's.

Version: 1.0.0.1
CVS tag: VERSION_1_0_0_1
Date: April 3 2008

1. Problems when running the parser on 64 bit machines were fixed. The parser
   now compiles and runs on 64 bit machines (I've only tested it on Linux
   with gcc v. 4.1.1).
2. A minor bug in the conversion of ccl link sets to brackets was fixed.
   It is possible that this bug had no influence on any of the bracketings
   actually generated by the current version of the parser.
3. A minor bug in the behavior of the -L feature was fixed. Before the
   fix, the value specified for the -L option on the first line of the
   execution sequence would become an upper bound on the number of
   input objects for all subsequent lines in the execution sequence.
   This has now been fixed.
